<h2>
<a name="why-me" class="anchor" href="#why-me"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Why Me?</strong>
</h2>

<p>I am passionate about making games and started working on it early in my college days. I have made some games with processing for <a href="www.programmr.com">programmr.com</a> as an intern, it was a great experience for me. For your perusal you can have a look at some of them : <a href="http://www.webeneers.com/srikanth/rana.html">catch-the-choc</a> , <a href="http://www.webeneers.com/srikanth/econo.html">Hit-to-save</a> , <a href="http://www.webeneers.com/srikanth/assange.html">collect them!</a> , <a href="http://www.webeneers.com/srikanth/assange.html">shuffle</a>. I am one of the core team member of <a href="www.getmeashop.com">getmeashop</a> (A platform that provide online e-stores) as a leading frontend developer.</p>

<h2>
<a name="why-codecombat" class="anchor" href="#why-codecombat"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Why CodeCombat?</strong>
</h2>

<p>One of my goals is to develop games on a big scale where people across the world can play and enjoy the same and fortunately, I found out your organisation which is a perfect platform for my ambition and also the project is appropriate for my skills.
In other words, this opportunity is much more than just a internship for me.</p>

<h2>
<a name="my-contribution" class="anchor" href="#my-contribution"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>My Contribution</strong>
</h2>

<p>I have formulated ideas to teach the classic algorithms via games in a simple and interesting way.Two of these ideas have been explained .</p>

<p>Moreover, as my college schedule permits, I can dedicate 20-30 hours a week to develop my games. And by april, I will have a lucid idea of all the algorithms that I am going to work upon.
So most of my work would be coding and improvising my ideas, with regular updates to my mentor, i would like to make 4 algorithms demos of six levels.
I can assure you that i would work to the best of my abilities and would just require the right direction to work towards successfully completing my project.</p>

<h2>
<a name="team-work" class="anchor" href="#team-work"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Team Work</strong>
</h2>

<p>Regarding remote collaboration, I have acquired an extensive experience working remotely for getmeashop over an year now and thus have had a great experience working in a team and would love to join your team as an active contributor.
I would share my progress regularly and would like to complete 40% to 50% of my work before<br>
the starting date of my project, i.e., deciding how i am going to make the demos efficiently. After all, optimization is what I strive for ;).</p>

<p>So far now i have planned to work upon Merge Sorting, Dijkstra's Algorithm, Travelling Salesman, Hill Climbing. If time permits, I would like to make two more algorithms demos along with these aforementioned algorithms.</p>

<a name="if-i-finish-early" class="anchor" href="#if-i-finish-early"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>If I finish Early</strong>
</h2>

<p>Moreover, if I finish my project early, I would like to contribute more by making games on more algorithms and if it turns out to be really hard for me to make any game on a specific algorithm even after trying my best i will switch to another algorithm after discussing with the CodeCombat team. </p>

<h2>
<a name="previous-experience" class="anchor" href="#previous-experience"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>Previous experience</strong>
</h2>

<p>I am a leading frontend developer in the getmeashop.com core team and have my crucial learning experience with this team about how quick a startup moves/works in developing/imporving their platform and how much understanding and team work would need for things to get work done and ship real fast.
I was an intern in programmr.com for making games with processing.js, this is my first encounter with making games,every time i make a game and take feedback from every possible interested person i learn how people would like or would be interested on a game to play.</p>

<h2>
<a name="my-commitments-during-the-period" class="anchor" href="#my-commitments-during-the-period"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><strong>My commitments during the Period</strong>
</h2>

<p>I have my summer vacations from 5th May, 2014 to the 24th July, 2014. .This would hardly take 4 hours of my time in a day.Importantly i can assure you a minimum of 8-9 hours in a day for my project </p>

<p>Lastly i want to say without contributing any patches or bug reports like others with my excitement about my dream thing i straight went into my project but i understand that your point of view on believing me as the right person, i will submit you one or two stages of a game as early as possible but surely before the judging dates. In case you want to take a call for the final students a bit early, it would be great if you could tell me so that I may hand over whatever work I’ve done to complete my application.</p>
