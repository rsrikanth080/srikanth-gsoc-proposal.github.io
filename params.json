I have made some games with processing for [programmr.com](www.programmr.com) as an intern, it was a great experience for me. For your perusal you can have a look at some of them : [catch-the-choc](http://www.webeneers.com/srikanth/rana.html) , [Hit-to-save](http://www.webeneers.com/srikanth/econo.html) , [collect them!](http://www.webeneers.com/srikanth/assange.html) , [shuffle](http://www.webeneers.com/srikanth/assange.html). I am one of the core team member of [getmeashop](www.getmeashop.com) (A platform that provide online e-stores) as a leading frontend developer.\r\n\r\n\r\n##**Why CodeCombat?**\r\nOne of my goals is to develop games on a big scale where people across the world can play and enjoy the same and fortunately, I found out your organisation which is a perfect platform for my ambition and also the project is appropriate for my skills.\r\nIn other words, this opportunity is much more than just a internship for me.\r\n\r\n##**My Contribution** \r\nI have formulated ideas to teach the classic algorithms via games in a simple and interesting way.Two of these ideas have been explained .\r\n \r\nMoreover, as my college schedule permits, I can dedicate 20-30 hours a week to develop my games. And by april, I will have a lucid idea of all the algorithms that I am going to work upon.\r\nSo most of my work would be coding and improvising my ideas, with regular updates to my mentor, i would like to make 4 algorithms demos of six levels.\r\nI can assure you that i would work to the best of my abilities and would just require the right direction to work towards successfully completing my project.\r\n \r\n##**Team Work**\r\nRegarding remote collaboration, I have acquired an extensive experience working remotely for getmeashop over an year now and thus have had a great experience working in a team and would love to join your team as an active contributor.\r\nI would share my progress regularly and would like to complete 40% to 50% of my work before   \r\nthe starting date of my project, i.e., deciding how i am going to make the demos efficiently. After all, optimization is what I strive for ;).\r\n\r\nSo far now i have planned to work upon Merge Sorting, Dijkstra's Algorithm, Travelling Salesman, Hill Climbing. If time permits, I would like to make two more algorithms demos along with these aforementioned algorithms.\r\n\r\n##**Time Schedule**\r\n\r\n###**19th may to 9th of June : Sorting Algorithms (you can find the levels demonstration here).**\r\n19th - 26th of may : first 2 levels.\r\n26th - 2nd June : next 2 levels.\r\n3rd - 9th june : next 2 levels\r\n###**10th June - 1st July : Dijkstra Algorithm**\r\n10th June - 17th June : A easy and simple problem demo of the algorithm which gives the idea about the how the algorithm works.\r\n18th june - 23rd june : A little complicated example for the perfect understanding of  Dijkstra Algorithm.\r\n_**Will be submitting the code up to this as Mid Term Submission **_\r\n18th june - 1st july : A real application example to demonstrate the Dijkstra Algorithm\r\n\r\n###**2nd July - 16th July : Travelling Salesman**\r\n2nd July - 9th July : Demo on kruskal’s algorithm(Minimal Spanning Tree - Lower bound of a route) \r\n10th July - 16th July : Demo to understand NNA(Nearest Neighbour Algorithm - Upper bound of the  route)\r\n17th July - 24th July : Demo of Depth First Tree Tour(DFTT)\r\n\r\n###**25th July - 11th August : Hill climbing**\r\n25th July - 1st August : Simple problem demonstration of Hill Climbing\r\n2st August - 10th August : A application of Hill climbing algorithm\r\n**11th July - 17th August : Total testing, Bug fixings, Documentations**\r\n**18th submission of total project of 6 algorithms.**\r\n\r\n##**If I finish Early**\r\nMoreover, if I finish my project early, I would like to contribute more by making games on more algorithms and if it turns out to be really hard for me to make any game on a specific algorithm even after trying my best i will switch to another algorithm after discussing with the CodeCombat team. \r\n\r\n##**Previous experience**\r\nI am a leading frontend developer in the getmeashop.com core team and have my crucial learning experience with this team about how quick a startup moves/works in developing/imporving their platform and how much understanding and team work would need for things to get work done and ship real fast.\r\nI was an intern in programmr.com for making games with processing.js, this is my first encounter with making games,every time i make a game and take feedback from every possible interested person i learn how people would like or would be interested on a game to play.\r\n\r\n\r\n##**My commitments during the Period**\r\nI have my summer vacations from 5th May, 2014 to the 24th July, 2014. .This would hardly take 4 hours of my time in a day.Importantly i can assure you a minimum of 8-9 hours in a day for my project \r\n\r\nLastly i want to say without contributing any patches or bug reports like others with my excitement about my dream thing i straight went into my project but i understand that your point of view on believing me as the right person, i will submit you one or two stages of a game as early as possible but surely before the judging dates. In case you want to take a call for the final students a bit early, it would be great if you could tell me so that I may hand over whatever work I’ve done to complete my application.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and in case of any queries please contact me on +917376591564 and rsrikanth080@gmail.com . I’m also available on Skype at rsrikanth080.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
